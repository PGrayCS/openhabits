## Privacy Manifesto (Draft)

1. Local by default – no silent network calls.
2. No trackers / ads / analytics scripts.
3. Export anytime (plain JSON) & instant reset.
4. Optional sync will be end-to-end encrypted; servers see ciphertext only.
5. Transparent permissions – explain at point of use.
6. Open source auditability.
7. Minimal data model – only what habits need.
8. Privacy review checklist before merging new features.
